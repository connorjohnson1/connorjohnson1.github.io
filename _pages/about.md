About me
======
I am a first year Ph.D. student in the neuroscience program at Brandeis University where I hope to bring a computational approach to learning and memory research. Prior to Brandeis, I worked as a Lab Manager in the lab of Dr. Alberto Cruz-Martin at Boston University, where I used miniscopes to investigate the role of [VIP expressing interneurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01485-y.epdf?sharing_token=Euvda72VoJvRPrpnFSwmJNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NaaIX09HuirwnoUHZqeNiLsO3dxSbdN7Q6PcOmGQ5asFW3BeV13coBlOsInsV9x8rlElM14B25K3SKgc-UQQ3BO4eRuJzu5m2s_sJwiJJwNA8RTrtH1hePFdwY_RnCMDc%3D). I also did my undergraduate at Boston University with Dr. Cruz-Martin studying the effects of [complement component 4 overexpression in layer 2/3 of the pre-frontal cortex](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000604). Before joining the Cruz-Martin lab I worked in the labs of Drs. Howard Eichenbaum and Michael Hasselmo studying entorhinal-hippocampal circuits in rats. 

I am very passionate about data analysis and building pipelines to support research projects. I recently completed the three week computation neuroscience course at Neuromatch Academy where I was able to build a stronger foundation of mathematical and computation approaches to analysis that I will defiunitely be building upon in my coursework and research during my Ph.D.
