I grew up in Kennebunk, ME exploring forests, fields, rivers and oceans. I was obsessed with finding and catching critters and studying them, so its no wonder that when I got older I discovered that I had a passion for biology. In my free time I enjoy exploring the nature outside of Boston, including hiking the White Mountains in New Hampshire. I also enjoy skiing up in Bethel, ME at Sunday River, but I'm trying to get over to the west coast more. I also really enjoy reading, some of my recent favorites are [The Emperor of All Maladies](https://www.amazon.com/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer/dp/1439170916) by Siddhartha Mukherjee and [The Idea Factory](https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=bell+labs&qid=1659370723&s=books&sprefix=bell+l%2Cstripbooks%2C82&sr=1-1) by Jon Gertner. My goal with this website will be to showcase my research as well as provide resources to new students pursuing careers in research.
