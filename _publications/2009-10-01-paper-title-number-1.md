A hallmark of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is its functional heterogeneity. Functional and imaging studies revealed its importance in the encoding of anxiety-related and social stimuli, but it is unknown how microcircuits within the ACC encode these distinct stimuli. One type of inhibitory interneuron, which is positive for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), is known to modulate the activity of pyramidal cells in local microcircuits, but it is unknown whether VIP cells in the ACC (VIPACC) are engaged by particular contexts or stimuli. Additionally, recent studies demonstrated that neuronal representations in other cortical areas can change over time at the level of the individual neuron. However, it is not known whether stimulus representations in the ACC remain stable over time. Using in vivo Ca2+ imaging and miniscopes in freely behaving mice to monitor neuronal activity with cellular resolution, we identiﬁed individual VIPACC that preferentially activated to distinct stimuli across diverse tasks. Importantly, although the population-level activity of the VIPACC remained stable across trials, the stimulus-selectivity of individual interneurons changed rapidly. These ﬁndings demonstrate marked functional heterogeneity and instability within interneuron populations in the ACC. This work contributes to our understanding of how the cortex encodes information across diverse contexts and provides insight into the complexity of neural processes involved in anxiety and social behavior.
